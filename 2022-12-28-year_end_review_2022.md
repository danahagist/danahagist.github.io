# 2022 Year in Review

In 2022, I continued many of the habits I developed over the last several years, but aimed to simplify my daily goals.

This consisted of breaking my goals into three simple groups outlined below, with one additional task for tracking progress.

**Those daily goals consisted of the following:**
1. Exercise the Mind: Reading or studying with the goal of learning something new
2. Exercise the Spirit: Do something that helps with your spiritual health. For me, this was/is typically meditation.
3. Exercise the Body: Move the body somehow
4. Record Weight: Check the progress on the scale

**How did I Do**
1. I Exercised the Mind 290 times (80% success rate)
2. I Exercised the Spirit 330 times (90% success rate)
Details: According to Insight Timer (my meditation app), in 2022 I meditated a total of 538 times for a total of just over 53 hours.
4. I Exercised the Body 320 times (88% success rate)
Details: According to Strava (my fitness app), in 2022 I ran 122 times for a total of 445 miles, cycled 220 times for a total of 3,038 miles and swam 16 times for a total of 20k yards. All of my training culinated in my toughest physical challenge yet, the 2022 California Ironman Triathlon.
6. I Recorded My Weight 260 times (70% success rate)
Details: My average weight in December 2021 was 201 pounds. My average weight for December 2022 has been 190 pounds. My lowest average weight for 2022 was in October and November where I averaged 184 pounds. My goal is to get down to a sustained 175 pounds (more to come on that in posts on 2023 goals).
