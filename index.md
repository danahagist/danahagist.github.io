# Welcome to Dana Data Life

### Dana – Dana Hagist, That’s Me
### Data – My Passion, My Career
### Life – Exploring, Learning, Growing

Dana Data Life is part blog, part portfolio, covering the above three themes.

The Dana section is a snapshot of myself and links to other resources related to my personal and professional life.

The Data section represents my journey in Analytics, including projects, reviews of books and courses, and more.

The Life section contains my observations and learnings about how to experience and live the best life possible.

My hope is to share my passion and empower or inspire people to find and pursue theirs.
