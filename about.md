My name is Dana Hagist.  I live in El Dorado Hills, CA and currently work as a Data Scientist at LinkedIn, focusing on our marketing business.  

Originally from Santa Cruz, CA., I’m a passionate about the outdoors and just about anything that is either physically or mentally challenging.

I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, compete in endurance events (marathons and triathlons), and spend most of the rest of my time reading or performing data analytics activities in Python or R (mostly working in Jupyter Notebooks).

I started this blog to make public my foray into the “Data Science” world.  I’m interested in collaborating, providing as much insight into my approach as possible, and gleaning insight from others.

I have an academic background (Masters Degree) in Economics, and am working tirelessly to elevate my Computer Science skills.

Thank you very much for checking out the site, and please do let me know if there is anything I can do to help you on your journey, or if you have any constructive advice for mine.

My hope is that this blog will at least be the jumping off point for some good conversation and connection with my fellow Data Science and Economics enthusiasts.

Cheers!
