### Abstract: 
Using Current Population Survey (CPS) data matched to gubernatorial election data from 
1978 to 2015, I estimate the causal impact of political partisanship under a Democratic or 
Republican governor on the pursuit of the American Dream. Specifically, I estimate how the 
partisanship of these parties impacts home ownership, having a job, not being in poverty, having 
some level of higher education, and being covered under a healthcare plan. Although these 
outcomes are often related, each of them are considered individually for this research. 
Furthermore, I estimate heterogeneous effects for different subsets of the population including 
blacks, whites, females and males by comparing across these groups. I utilize a regression 
discontinuity (RD) design with state and year fixed-effects, and find that under a Democratic 
governor: Employment rates are flat to slightly decreasing for white individuals and increase for 
black individuals. Poverty rates are relatively flat for white individuals and decrease for blacks. 
When comparing women to men, college education rates decrease for men but increase for 
women. Employment rates are flat to slightly decreasing for men and increase for women. 
Poverty rates decrease for women relative to no change for men. Under a Republican governor, 
there is evidence of a large disadvantage for both blacks and women, so the impact of having a 
Democratic governor appears to narrow this gap.
