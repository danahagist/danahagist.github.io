### Review by Dana Hagist
  
My Book Rating: 5/5
    
I took a lot away from reading this book, and rather than rattling off a summary of all of the content, here are the three lessons that resonated with me the most:  
  
### Lesson 1: Fight the Provocation

Book says "Remember always: As wrong as they are, as annoying as it is, it takes two for a real conflict to happen. As the Stoics said, when we are offended, when we fight, we are complicit. We have __chosen__ to engage. We have traded self-control for self-indulgence. We've allowed our cooler head to turn hot--even though we know hot heads rarely make good decisions.

### Lesson 2: TBD

There are many other valuable lessons in this book, especially for those in leadership positions and I highly encourage a read. I will be working on my own ability to take ownership, prioritize and execute, and keep it simple.
