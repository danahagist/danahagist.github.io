### Review by Dana Hagist
  
My Book Rating: 5/5
    
I took a lot away from reading this book, and rather than rattling off a summary of all of the content, here are the three lessons that resonated with me the most:  
  
### Lesson 1: Fight the Provocation

Book says "Remember always: As wrong as they are, as annoying as it is, it takes two for a real conflict to happen. As the Stoics said, when we are offended, when we fight, we are complicit. We have __chosen__ to engage. We have traded self-control for self-indulgence. We've allowed our cooler head to turn hot--even though we know hot heads rarely make good decisions.

### Lesson 2: Get Better Every Day
Book says "Come what may, success or failure, fame or misfortune, a focus on progress lets us look ourselves in the mirror with pride and ignore all the commotion in the background," and goes on "It's the journey of a lifetime. In fact, that's the way to think about all of this: How much progress could you make if you made just a little each day over the course of an entire life? What might this journey look like, where might it lead, if each bit of progress you made presented both the opportunity and the obligation to make a little more progress, and you seized those opportunities, you lived up to those obligations, each and every time?"

### Lesson 3: TBD

There are many other valuable lessons in this book, especially for those in leadership positions and I highly encourage a read. I will be working on my own ability to take ownership, prioritize and execute, and keep it simple.
