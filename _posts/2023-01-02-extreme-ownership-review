# Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin
## Review by Dana Hagist
  
My Personal Review: 5/5

It's fascinating as you read through "Extreme Ownership" by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin the vast and striking similarities that can be drawn between military strategy for leadership and combat to business strategy and leadership.

I took a lot away from reading this book, and rather than rattling off a summary of all of the content, I'll leave you with the three lessons that resonated with me the most.

Lesson 1: Practice Extreme Ownership  
Of all lessons in this book, this is the central theme. If you want to be a strong and respected leader, take ownership of everything that impacts you and your mission/goal. If something goes wrong, do not make excuses, do not blame others. Acknowledge your failures and limitations. Learn from your mistakes. Develop a plan and strategy to remedy those mistakes and be better. Approach conversations up and down your chain of command with a posture of owning problems and seeking solutions. Always first look in the mirror and ask what you could have done better.

Lesson 2: Prioritize and Execute
We all get bogged down and overwhelmed with work or personal situations. I've often experienced what is called "paralysis by analysis" as a result of this overwhelm.

Lesson 3: Keep it Simple
Often when we are not getting the result we are looking for from other people, it's helpful to first ask how simple your communication was. 

There are countless other valuable lessons in this book, and especially for those who are in leadership positions and I highly encourage a read.
