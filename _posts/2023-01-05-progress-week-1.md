# Focus Last Week
1. Get a healthy foundation back through exercise and healthy diet
2. Re-adjust to sobriety
3. Work to establish and adjust to my new daily habits

# What's Working?
1. Habit App is helping me stay focused and organized. There are a lot of great habit-tracking apps out there. I've tried Strides, Streaks and now Habit. Each have pros and cons in my experience but I like the flexibility and tracking available in the Habit app
2. Clean eating and exercise has resulted in dropping 6 pounds. This has probably been the biggest change in my life, and it's an entirely new world shopping for and preparing healthy meals. I've got a lot to learn but the diet is helping. 6 pounds in a week is a solid start
3. I'm enjoying and benefiting from my daily goal of "Creation" (Writing, Blogging). Hence the post you're reading

# What's Not Working?
1. I'm not very efficient yet at getting through my daily goals. My day feels clunky and forced as a result
2. It's possible that I start butting up against tracking fatigue. That is, I find myself in my app constantly making updates. I may need to make adjustments for that to be more sustainable
3. With some of my daily goals, I feel like they don't go far enough. As an example, spending only 5 minutes creating hasn't been enough to make meaningful progress. I have to remind myself that these goals are designed intentionally to be sure I can do them every day. It's okay to exceed the goal, but the standards are set low so my ability to make excuses is small as well

# Adjustments to Make
1. Determine whether I need to consolidate/simplify my goals. It's important to not spend all day not staring at my phone and inhibiting my ability to life and enjoy life. No adjustments needed just yet though.
2. Starting a new diet is a big change. It impacts how you shop, how you cook, when you eat and more. I've started a delivery service to help with half of my healthy meals each week. This should at least help familiarize me with the sorts of things that I can/should be eating.
3. I need to be patient with myself. I'm an execution focused person who wants everything to be done and structured today. But, in order for lifestyle changes to be sustainable, not everything needs to be figured out today. I need to trust in and enjoy the process.
