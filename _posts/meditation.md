# Why Meditate
I've heard and read in many books on leadership, philosophy and mental health that if you want to be able to reach your full potential, you must learn to manage your mind. At first glance, this may come off as nothing more than cliche' cookie cutter wisdom without much practical value. But, for those who spend time meditating, reflecting, setting intentions, being grateful or otherwise mindful will tell you, managing your mind is something you can actually do (and should do) by practicing it each day. 

According to [thegoodbody.com](https://www.thegoodbody.com/meditation-statistics/),

> When asked why they started meditating, participants in the 2012 US National Health Interview Survey gave the following top reasons:

> - General wellness (76.2%)
> - Improving energy (60%)
> - Aiding memory or concentration (50%)
> - Anxiety (29.2%)
> - Stress (21.6%)
> - Depression (17.8%)

# My Journey with Meditation
I started meditating a few years back and like many others, I started off as a bit of a skeptic. 

# Many Others Have Found Immense Value in Meditation
Among the 200-500 people globally who meditate, many of the most influential and powerful leaders have shared the life-changing impact that meditation has had on their lives. Online, you can find collections and stories of famous meditators like the [50 Famous People Who Meditate List](https://www.meditationwise.com/50-famous-people-who-meditate). 

One person on this list, Steve Jobs, explained the benefits of meditation like this:

> “If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there’s room to hear more subtle things—that’s when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before.”

Do you think there is value in being able to see more, to notice subtlety or change your perspective by quieting your busy mind? If you're anything like I am, you probably think there is immense value there. The world is often busy and chaotic, throwing decisions, challenges and stiumlation at us constantly. Being able to actually find sanctuary internally is a huge gift that you can benefit greatly from.
