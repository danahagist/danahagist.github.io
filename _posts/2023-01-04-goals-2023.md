title: 2023 Goals: Looking Ahead
---
In 2023, I will continue most of the habits I developed over the last several years and have added some additional ones.   

**Those daily goals are the following:**
1. Abstain from Alcohol
2. Exercise the Mind by Reading, Researching or Studying
3. Exercise the Body through Exercise
4. Exercise the Spirit through Meditation or Prayer
5. Measure Weight
6. Do a Cold Plunge or Cold Shower
7. Measure Blood Pressure
8. Take a Progress Pic
9. Eat Clean (4 Servings each of Vegetables, Fruits, Whole Grains)
10. Drink Minimum of 64oz of Water
11. Do something Creative (Write, Blog)

**I've also added the following weekly goals:**
1. Build Community
2. Random Act of Kindness for my Wife
3. Post on Blog
4. Post on Social Media (something helpful/motivational/intentional)

**What's the purpose of these goals?**
1. Feel strong and healthy by approaching health holistically
2. Be able to reflect and share my journey through regular creating and sharing of photos and writing
3. Build a network in my local community and find ways to give back through volunteering or providing other types of support
